<p>My name is Mike Sanders and I formed Meikos Consulting LLC back in 2009 to do Corp to Corp work. It is time that it gets its own site. The web is vastly different than how it was back in 1997. It was back then that I first started doing websites like the Children's Miracle Network site for St. Louis. I will blog about the new technologies used for this site, including how to use Content Management systems to feed content to a website like the one I am typing in now.</p><p>As of now the site is mostly a brochure web site, with my rates and services I offer. I do have a contact page that site readers can message me about work. Meikos Consulting is also the operating entity behind <a href="https://teamgig.solutions/?ref=ghostcms.meikos.internal" rel="noreferrer">TeamGig Solutions</a>, a marketplace for software experts to team up in the gig economy.</p><p></p>
