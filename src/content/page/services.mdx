                    <p class="w3-left-align">My greatest skill is with data. I have the experience with doing 3 month long data migrations in the past and I am a stickler for data accuracy.</p>
                    <p class="w3-left-align">These migrations include monthly billing mock runs to validate the data is what it is supposed to be. If you need an environment setup to do this it is included in the price. An environment for these monthly mock runs or any testing is highly recommended.</p>
